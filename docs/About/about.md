I am currently a master student at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn), Beijing, P.R.China. My research interests include **applied cryptograpy** and **privacy-preserving computing**. I am highly interested in theoretical computer science as well as the real-world application and implementation of these frontier technologies. Before, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Information Security from [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn), Beijing, P.R.China, where I was introduced to cryptograpy and decided to further my studies in this field.

Apart from these, I am interested in virtualization and novel safety-oriented PLs like rust and zig. I am also interested in technologies in blockchain/web3, especially layer2, NFTs, and RWA. With [PKU Blockchain Association](https://x.com/PKUBlockchain) I attended the ETH Beijing Hackthon and got a third prize.

For now I am working at [Ant Group](https://www.antgroup.com/) as a research intern, which will last until about March 2025 (before Qingming Festival). I am actively looking for internship with respect to cryptography, MPC, and blockchain. I am also searching for good opportunities to do a PhD in theoretical computer science, math, and cryptography.

## About the picture

![無負今日](/public/logo.png)

This is a piece of calligraphy created by Liang Qichao (梁啓超), one of the pioneers who inspired the political reformation of modern China. The four characters (from right to left) pronounce as wú2 fù4 jīn1 rì4. It can be translated as "Do not waste today" and is from an article Liang Qichao wrote to young people in China during the invasion of the Eight-Nation Alliance:

> 昨日已逝，逝者如斯，明日未至，前景何知，唯今日握在诸君手中，尤应呵护之，珍爱之，记挂之，驾驭之。

> 今日者，当下也，此刻也。今日者，居于宇宙时空之中。此中者，菲庸庸碌碌，不进不退之中，实乃承上启下，继往开来之中，有昨日之积淀，传承、孕育，方有今日躬行、奋进、改造，遂有明日。

> 今日者，荡涤昨日之旧我，建设明日之新我，唯笃行，唯耕耘，唯进步也。一切事业皆自今日始，一切学问皆从今日作，一切法想皆与今日起，一切志向皆在今日立。今日自强，则明日宏阔；今日蕴聚，则明日丰沛；今日努力，则明日可成；今日有为，则明日可期。

> 无今日之涓滴，则无将来之汪洋；无今日之册页，则无将来之典章；无今日之苞蕾，则无将来之繁花；无今日之土石，则无将来之重嶂。

> 识今日之有限，追将来之无穷；驰今日支白驹，御将来之腾龙；汇今日之小我，成将来之大公。

> 今日之重，譬犹泰山，万仞登临，踊跃跻攀，一寸一进，一步一前，巍哉其势，我为峰巅。今日之美，譬犹阳春，新笋初发，雨露氤氲，万物喷薄，时序更新，昔时勉励，岁不待人。今日之华，譬犹年少。宝剑锋铓，青春乐好。死生亦大，忽然将老，有花堪折，莫待枯槁。

> 今日之实，譬犹开卷，革旧兴智，求索修远，学为人师，行为世范，在明明德，止于至善。一朝一夕，即日即逝，一时一刻，今日须惜，今有一语赠诸君，何惧流年匆匆，但求不负今日。
